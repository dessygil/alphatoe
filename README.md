# AlphaToe
AlphaToe is to tic tac toe as AlphaGo is to GO. For context if you unaware of AlphaGo, it is a company called DeepMind which built an AI that has the capability
to play the game called GO. AlphaToe uses a hashmap instead of using any sort of machine learning techniques, so it wouldn't be deemed as AI, but I still guarantee 
you won't be able to beat it no matter what!

## How To Set AlphaToe Up

1. Navigate to the file in the terminal
2. Type 'make' into the terminal creating the needed files to play
3. Type './alphatoe' into the terminal to begin the game
4. Pick whether to be X's or O's (Pick X, they go firt)
5. Now pick a number between 0-8 to choose your position
6. AlphaToe will now pick its spot 
7. Repeat step 5 and 6 until the game is won or ends in a tie 

## What languages were used
Javascript (Jquery)
HTML/CSS
C 

## ideas
there will be a score board on each
you automatically start as X
automatically retstart after game
it will draw a line through the winning line and then wait a second before restarting 
then done 

## whats new

using a virtual environment through python -m venv myEnv
use 'source myEnv/bin/activate' to get in
use 'python 'pip install django djangorestframework'
